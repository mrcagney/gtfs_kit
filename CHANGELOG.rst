Changelog
=========

11.0.0, 2025-09-23
------------------
- Breaking change: simplified ``constants.py``.
- Breaking change: renamed ``compute_feed_stats`` and ``compute_feed_time_series`` to ``compute_network_stats`` and ``compute_network_time_series``, respectively.

10.3.1, 2025-06-04
------------------
- Bugfixed ``routes.get_routes``, which was deleting shapes shared across routes.
- Added to ``notebooks/examples.py`` an example of plotting routes with GeoPandas's ``explore`` method.

10.3.0, 2025-04-30
------------------
- In ``cleaners.drop_zombies``, additionally dropped agencies without routes.
- Fixed ``routes.get_routes`` to handle the case when at least one of a route's shapes is a point.
- Turned the example notebook into a Marimo notebook.

10.2.2, 2025-03-13
------------------
- Bugfixed an edge case in the function ``shapes.split_simple``.

10.2.1, 2025-03-12
------------------
- Added a forgotten ``drop_duplicates('shape_id')`` line to the function ``miscellany.compute_screen_line_counts``, which speeds things up on large sets of screen lines.

10.2.0, 2025-03-12
------------------
- Improved ``miscellany.compute_screen_line_counts`` to now properly handle trips with non-simple shapes.
- Added ``shapes.split_simple`` to help with the new screen line computation, but users might find it useful for other things too.

10.1.1, 2025-01-21
------------------
- Bugfixed ``trips.compute_trip_activity`` which cleverly and wrongly cast values to integers.
- Improved ``trips.get_active_services`` to handle feeds with only one of ``calendar.txt`` and ``calendar_dates.txt``.

10.1.0, 2025-01-09
------------------
- Handled null values better thanks to `pull request 22 <https://github.com/mrcagney/gtfs_kit/pull/22>`_.

- Updated ``miscellany.restrict_to_trips`` to also include the parent stations of the trip stops.
- Forgot to import ``miscellany.restrict_to_trips`` in ``feed`` in last release. Fixed that.

10.0.0, 2024-12-20
------------------
- Added ``miscellany.restrict_to_trips`` and used it as a helper function to simplify the other restriction functions.
- Breaking change: Removed the validation module ``validators.py`` to avoid duplicating the work of what is now `the canonical feed validator <https://github.com/MobilityData/gtfs-validator>`_ (written in Java).
- Breaking change: Changed ``feed.write`` to ``feed.to_file`` and stopped default rounding.
- Breaking change: Changed ``miscellany.summarize`` to ``miscellany.list_fields`` and stopped default rounding.

9.0.0, 2024-12-19
-----------------
- Breaking change: Replaced ``trips.is_active_trip`` with ``trips.get_active_services`` and removed the derived feed attributes ``trips_i``, ``calendar_i``, and ``calendar_dates_i`` as no longer necessary and overly complex.

8.1.4, 2024-12-19
-----------------
- Added ``restrict_to_agencies`` to ``feed`` module local imports. Whoops!

8.0.0, 2024-10-08
-----------------
