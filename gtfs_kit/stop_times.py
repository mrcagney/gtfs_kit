    This does not always give accurate results.
    The algorithm works as follows.
    Compute the ``shape_dist_traveled`` field by using Shapely to
    measure the distance of a stop along its trip LineString.
    If for a given trip this process produces a non-monotonically
    increasing, hence incorrect, list of (cumulative) distances, then
    fall back to estimating the distances as follows.

    Set the first distance to 0, the last to the length of the trip shape,
    and leave the remaining ones computed above.
    Choose the longest increasing subsequence of that new set of
    distances and use them and their corresponding departure times to linearly
    interpolate the rest of the distances.
